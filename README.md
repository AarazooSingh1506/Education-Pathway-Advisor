Create a personalized education recommendation system that analyzes a student's academic history, interests, strengths, and career goals to suggest relevant subjects and courses. Consider the following inputs:

Academic performance: GPA, test scores, and grades in specific subjects
Previous coursework and areas of study
Stated interests and hobbies
Career aspirations and professional goals
Learning style preferences
Time availability and schedule constraints
Generate detailed recommendations that include:

3-5 primary subject areas aligned with the student's profile
Specific courses within each subject area, ranked by relevance
Brief explanation for each recommendation (2-3 sentences)
Suggested learning path or course sequence
Alternative options if primary recommendations don't suit the student
Potential career paths related to the recommended subjects
